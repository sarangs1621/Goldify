# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Admin edits are logged with special 'admin_override_edit' action including reason, locked_at, locked_by, and changes. (2) Modified DELETE /api/jobcards/{id} endpoint - Locked job cards cannot be deleted by regular users (403 error). Admins can override and delete locked job cards. Admin deletes are logged with special 'admin_override_delete' action including reason, locked_at, locked_by, jobcard_number, and customer_name. (3) Enhanced audit trail - All admin overrides create detailed audit logs with override_details containing action, reason, original lock information, and changes made. This ensures complete accountability while allowing authorized personnel to make necessary corrections. Regular users receive clear error messages indicating admin-only override capability."

Fixed missing created_by field issue. ✅ Full Workflow Test - All 5 atomic operations work correctly: invoice finalization, stock OUT movements with negative values, job card locking, ledger entry creation, outstanding balance updates. ✅ Error Cases - Proper 400 errors for editing/deleting locked job cards, re-finalizing invoices, graceful handling of invoices without customers.

App is functional but missing critical production features like edit/delete operations, validation, security enhancements, and user experience improvements.

    message: "PHASE 1 & 2 COMPLETED: Enhanced Reports API and UI implemented. Added comprehensive filtering (date range, status, type, category), view endpoints for displaying data in UI, individual report details (invoice, party ledger, inventory stock), and export with filters. Reports page now has tabbed interface with Inventory, Invoices, Parties, and Transactions sections. Backend CRUD operations were already implemented. Now ready for testing."
