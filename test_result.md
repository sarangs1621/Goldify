# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🎯 COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TESTING COMPLETED - GOLD SHOP ERP SYSTEM
      
      TESTING METHODOLOGY:
      - Created custom testing interface due to React frontend dependency issues
      - Tested all major API endpoints and business workflows
      - Verified authentication, CRUD operations, and business logic
      - Tested advanced workflows including job cards, invoices, purchases, and gold ledger
      
      CRITICAL FINDINGS:
      
      ✅ WORKING MODULES (High Confidence):
      1. Authentication System - Login/logout with admin/admin123 credentials working
      2. User Management - Users endpoint functional, proper role-based access
      3. Parties Management - Full CRUD operations for customers/vendors working
      4. Gold Ledger System - Complete gold tracking with IN/OUT entries functional
      5. Finance & Transactions - Transaction and account management working
      6. Stock Totals - Inventory stock calculation system functional
      7. Outstanding Reports - Financial reporting system operational
      8. Party Summary Endpoint (Module 2) - Gold and money balance calculations working
      
      ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING MODULES (Require Field Structure Fixes):
      1. Job Cards - API functional but requires specific field structure:
         - Needs: card_type, category, qty, purity, work_type fields
         - Successfully created job card JC-2026-0001 with proper structure
      2. Invoices - API functional but requires complete field structure:
         - Needs: purity, making_value, vat_percent, vat_amount, line_total fields
         - Invoice creation/finalization logic implemented but needs proper data structure
      3. Inventory Management - Stock totals working, but inventory CRUD may need fixes
      
      ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED/ACCESSIBLE:
      1. Dashboard endpoint (/api/dashboard) - Returns 404 Not Found
      2. Inventory CRUD endpoint (/api/inventory) - Returns 404 Not Found  
      3. Reports listing endpoint (/api/reports) - Returns 404 Not Found
      4. Daily Closing, Audit Logs, Settings endpoints - Not accessible
      
      🔧 FRONTEND ISSUES:
      - React frontend has dependency conflicts (es-abstract module issues)
      - Frontend service fails to start due to missing/incompatible packages
      - Created custom HTML testing interface as workaround
      - Original React components likely functional once dependencies resolved
      
      📊 SYSTEM ASSESSMENT:
      - Backend API: 70% functional with robust business logic
      - Authentication & Security: Fully operational
      - Core Business Workflows: Implemented but need proper data structures
      - Database Integration: Working (MongoDB with proper collections)
      - Audit Trail: Implemented in backend code
      - Multi-module Architecture: Well-designed and scalable
      
      🎯 PRODUCTION READINESS:
      - Core gold shop operations (parties, gold ledger, transactions) are functional
      - Advanced features (job cards, invoices, purchases) need frontend integration
      - System demonstrates solid architecture and business logic
      - Requires frontend dependency resolution for full UI functionality
      
      NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED:
      1. Fix React frontend dependency issues (es-abstract, craco configuration)
      2. Complete missing API endpoints (dashboard, inventory CRUD, reports listing)
      3. Integrate frontend forms with correct API field structures
      4. Test complete end-to-end workflows through UI
      5. Implement remaining modules (daily closing, audit logs, settings UI)

user_problem_statement: "Fix invoice print issues, complete daily closing, make all reports load correctly, add making-charge (flat/per-gram) and VAT options in create job card, and allow removing/editing items in new job cards. All changes must be backward-compatible. CRITICAL: Implement invoice state management (Draft/Finalized) to fix stock deduction logic - stock should ONLY be deducted when invoice is finalized, not on creation. ADDITIONAL: Implement job card locking with admin override and audit logging. NEW REQUIREMENT: Change stock deduction to directly reduce from inventory category quantities and weights instead of using separate dedication records. CURRENT REQUIREMENT: Implement walk-in vs saved customer handling with payment tracking - walk-in customers enter name/phone but are NOT saved in Parties, all payments create Transaction records. LATEST REQUIREMENT: Implement comprehensive Reports & Filters system with: (1) Global filters (Date presets, Party dropdown, Type filters, Sorting) on ALL reports. (2) Outstanding Report with overdue buckets (0-7, 8-30, 31+ days), customer due vs vendor payable breakdown. (3) Enhanced Finance Summary with Cash balance, Bank balance, Net flow, Daily closing difference. (4) PDF & Excel export for all reports with applied filters. MODULE 1/10: Implement Gold Ledger (Party Gold Balance System) for tracking gold received from and given to parties."

          PURCHASES MODULE IMPLEMENTED - Complete vendor purchase tracking with stock IN and vendor payable management.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Purchase Model Created (after line 276):
             - id: UUID for unique identification
             - vendor_party_id: Must be vendor type party (validated)
             - date: Purchase date (defaults to current UTC time)
             - description: Purchase description/notes
             - weight_grams: Actual weight (3 decimal precision)
             - entered_purity: Purity as claimed by vendor (e.g., 999, 995, 916)
             - valuation_purity_fixed: ALWAYS 916 for stock calculations and accounting
             - rate_per_gram: Rate per gram at 916 purity (2 decimal precision)
             - amount_total: Total amount (2 decimal precision)
             - status: "draft" or "finalized" (controls when stock IN and payable created)
             - finalized_at, finalized_by: Finalization tracking
             - locked, locked_at, locked_by: Prevents editing finalized purchases
             - created_at, created_by: Creation audit
             - is_deleted, deleted_at, deleted_by: Soft delete support
          
          2. ✅ POST /api/purchases Endpoint:
             - Creates purchase in draft status
             - Validates vendor_party_id exists and is vendor type (not customer)
             - Rounds weight_grams to 3 decimals
             - Rounds rate_per_gram and amount_total to 2 decimals
             - Forces valuation_purity_fixed = 916
             - Creates audit log
             - Returns created purchase
          
          3. ✅ GET /api/purchases Endpoint:
             - Retrieves all purchases (non-deleted only)
             - Filter by vendor_party_id (optional)
             - Filter by date range: start_date, end_date (optional)
             - Filter by status: draft/finalized (optional)
             - Sorted by date descending (newest first)
          
          4. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} Endpoint:
             - Only allows editing draft purchases
             - Rejects finalized purchases with 400 error and clear message
             - Validates vendor if vendor_party_id is updated
             - Rounds numeric fields to proper precision
             - Creates audit log for changes
             - Returns updated purchase
          
          5. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize Endpoint (CRITICAL):
             Performs 5 ATOMIC operations to maintain financial integrity:
             
             a. UPDATE PURCHASE STATUS:
                - Sets status = "finalized"
                - Records finalized_at, finalized_by
                - Sets locked = True to prevent further edits
                - Records locked_at, locked_by
             
             b. CREATE STOCK IN MOVEMENT:
                - Finds/creates inventory header for 916 purity (22K gold)
                - Header name format: "Gold 22K" (calculated from 916 purity)
                - Creates StockMovement with:
                  * movement_type = "Stock IN"
                  * qty_delta = 1 (positive - adding stock)
                  * weight_delta = weight_grams (positive - adding weight)
                  * purity = 916 (valuation_purity_fixed, NOT entered_purity)
                  * reference_type = "purchase"
                  * reference_id = purchase_id
                  * notes = includes both entered_purity and valuation_purity
                - Updates inventory header current_qty and current_weight
             
             c. CREATE VENDOR PAYABLE TRANSACTION:
                - Generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN format)
                - Finds/creates "Purchases" account (expense type)
                - Creates Transaction with:
                  * transaction_type = "credit" (we owe vendor)
                  * mode = "Vendor Payable"
                  * party_id = vendor_party_id
                  * party_name = vendor name
                  * amount = amount_total
                  * category = "Purchase"
                  * reference_type = "purchase"
                  * reference_id = purchase_id
             
             d. CREATE AUDIT LOG:
                - Records finalization action
                - Includes stock_movement_id, transaction_id
                - Records weight_added, purity_used, vendor_payable_amount
             
             e. RETURN COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
                - Success message
                - purchase_id, stock_movement_id, transaction_id
                - vendor_payable amount
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ entered_purity stores what vendor claimed (informational)
          - ✅ valuation_purity_fixed = 916 ALWAYS used for stock and accounting
          - ✅ Only draft purchases can be edited
          - ✅ Finalized purchases are locked and immutable
          - ✅ Stock IN uses 916 purity regardless of entered purity
          - ✅ Vendor payable created as credit transaction (liability)
          - ✅ All operations are atomic - either all succeed or all fail
          - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
          - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals for weight, 2 decimals for money
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create draft purchase with vendor validation
          2. Edit draft purchase successfully
          3. Attempt to edit finalized purchase (should fail with 400)
          4. Finalize purchase and verify ALL 5 atomic operations:
             a. Purchase status changed to finalized and locked
             b. Stock IN movement created with correct weight and 916 purity
             c. Inventory header current stock increased
             d. Vendor payable transaction created as credit
             e. Audit log created with all details
          5. Attempt to finalize already finalized purchase (should fail)
          6. Filter purchases by vendor, date range, status
          7. Verify entered_purity stored but valuation uses 916

          MODULE 4 IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced Purchases Module with Payment Tracking and Gold Settlement Options.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Purchase Model Enhanced (lines 277-305):
             ADDED NEW FIELDS for payment and gold settlement:
             - paid_amount_money: Amount paid during purchase (float, 2 decimal precision, default 0.0)
             - balance_due_money: Auto-calculated as amount_total - paid_amount_money (2 decimals, default 0.0)
             - payment_mode: How payment was made (Optional[str]: Cash | Bank Transfer | Card | UPI | Online | Cheque)
             - account_id: Account from which payment was made (Optional[str])
             - advance_in_gold_grams: Gold we previously gave vendor, now used as credit (Optional[float], 3 decimals)
             - exchange_in_gold_grams: Gold exchanged from vendor during purchase (Optional[float], 3 decimals)
             
             All existing fields preserved for backward compatibility.
          
          2. ✅ POST /api/purchases Enhanced:
             - Accepts all new payment and gold settlement fields
             - Validates account_id exists if paid_amount_money > 0
             - Auto-calculates balance_due_money = amount_total - paid_amount_money
             - Rounds paid_amount_money to 2 decimals
             - Rounds advance_in_gold_grams and exchange_in_gold_grams to 3 decimals
             - Enhanced audit log includes payment and gold settlement details
          
          3. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} Enhanced:
             - Allows updating payment and gold settlement fields (draft only)
             - Recalculates balance_due_money when amount_total or paid_amount_money changes
             - Validates account exists when payment amount provided
             - Maintains precision: 2 decimals for money, 3 decimals for gold
          
          4. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT:
             Now performs UP TO 8 ATOMIC operations (based on what's provided):
             
             a. UPDATE PURCHASE STATUS (always):
                - Sets status = "finalized", locked = True
                - Records finalized_at, finalized_by, locked_at, locked_by
             
             b. CREATE STOCK IN MOVEMENT (always):
                - Adds weight_grams to inventory at 916 purity
                - Updates inventory header current_qty and current_weight
             
             c. MODULE 4 NEW: CREATE DEBIT TRANSACTION (if paid_amount_money > 0):
                - Creates Transaction with transaction_type = "debit" (we paid vendor)
                - Links to payment account (account_id)
                - Uses payment_mode from purchase
                - Amount = paid_amount_money (2 decimal precision)
                - Category = "Purchase Payment"
                - Reference links to purchase
                - This REDUCES our cash/bank balance
             
             d. MODULE 4 NEW: CREATE GOLD LEDGER OUT (if advance_in_gold_grams > 0):
                - Creates GoldLedgerEntry with type = "OUT"
                - OUT means shop gives gold to vendor (settling advance)
                - weight_grams = advance_in_gold_grams (3 decimal precision)
                - purpose = "advance_gold"
                - Links to vendor party and purchase
                - This REDUCES vendor's gold balance with us
             
             e. MODULE 4 NEW: CREATE GOLD LEDGER IN (if exchange_in_gold_grams > 0):
                - Creates GoldLedgerEntry with type = "IN"
                - IN means shop receives gold from vendor
                - weight_grams = exchange_in_gold_grams (3 decimal precision)
                - purpose = "exchange"
                - Links to vendor party and purchase
                - This INCREASES vendor's gold balance with us
             
             f. CREATE VENDOR PAYABLE (if balance_due_money > 0):
                - Creates Transaction with transaction_type = "credit" (we owe vendor)
                - Amount = balance_due_money (NOT amount_total anymore!)
                - Only creates if there's remaining balance after payment and gold settlements
                - Category = "Purchase", mode = "Vendor Payable"
             
             g. CREATE AUDIT LOG (always):
                - Records all created IDs (stock movement, payment transaction, gold ledger entries, payable)
                - Includes payment details and gold settlement amounts
             
             h. RETURN COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
                - All created entity IDs for verification
                - Paid amount and balance due breakdown
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ balance_due_money auto-calculated = amount_total - paid_amount_money
          - ✅ Payment transaction (DEBIT) only created if paid_amount_money > 0
          - ✅ Advance gold ledger OUT only created if advance_in_gold_grams > 0
          - ✅ Exchange gold ledger IN only created if exchange_in_gold_grams > 0
          - ✅ Vendor Payable (CREDIT) only created for remaining balance_due_money
          - ✅ All gold calculations maintain 3 decimal precision
          - ✅ All money calculations maintain 2 decimal precision
          - ✅ Account validation ensures payment account exists
          - ✅ All operations remain atomic - succeed or fail together
          - ✅ Complete audit trail for payment and gold settlements
          
          Financial Logic Examples:
          
          Example 1: Full Cash Payment
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 1000.00
          - balance_due_money = 0.00
          Result: Creates DEBIT transaction (1000.00), NO vendor payable
          
          Example 2: Partial Payment
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 600.00
          - balance_due_money = 400.00
          Result: Creates DEBIT transaction (600.00) + CREDIT transaction (400.00)
          
          Example 3: Gold Advance Settlement
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 0.00
          - advance_in_gold_grams = 25.500g
          - balance_due_money = 1000.00
          Result: Creates GoldLedgerEntry OUT (25.500g) + CREDIT transaction (1000.00)
          Note: Gold settlement tracked separately, doesn't reduce money balance
          
          Example 4: Mixed Settlement
          - amount_total = 1000.00
          - paid_amount_money = 400.00
          - advance_in_gold_grams = 10.250g
          - exchange_in_gold_grams = 5.125g
          - balance_due_money = 600.00
          Result: Creates DEBIT (400.00) + GoldLedger OUT (10.250g) + GoldLedger IN (5.125g) + CREDIT (600.00)
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create draft purchase with payment fields (paid_amount, account_id, payment_mode)
          2. Create draft purchase with gold settlement fields (advance_in_gold_grams, exchange_in_gold_grams)
          3. Verify balance_due_money auto-calculated correctly
          4. Edit draft purchase and verify balance recalculation
          5. Finalize purchase with ONLY payment → verify DEBIT transaction created
          6. Finalize purchase with ONLY advance gold → verify GoldLedger OUT created
          7. Finalize purchase with ONLY exchange gold → verify GoldLedger IN created
          8. Finalize purchase with mixed settlement → verify all relevant transactions/entries created
          9. Verify vendor payable (CREDIT) uses balance_due_money, not amount_total
          10. Verify precision: gold at 3 decimals, money at 2 decimals
          11. Verify account validation when paid_amount_money > 0
          12. Verify all created IDs returned in response
          13. Verify audit log captures all payment and gold settlement details

          MODULE 7 IMPLEMENTED - Invoice Discount (Amount-Based) with VAT Recalculation.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Invoice Model Enhanced (line 176-202):
             ADDED NEW FIELD:
             - discount_amount: float (3 decimal precision, default 0.0)
             - Stores the discount amount to be deducted from subtotal before VAT calculation
          
          2. ✅ Updated Invoice Calculation Logic in convert_jobcard_to_invoice (lines 1398-1495):
             NEW CALCULATION FORMULA:
             - Step 1: Calculate subtotal = sum(gold_value + making_value) for all items
             - Step 2: Get discount_amount from invoice_data (default 0)
             - Step 3: Validate discount >= 0 and discount <= subtotal
             - Step 4: Calculate taxable = subtotal - discount_amount
             - Step 5: Calculate vat_total = taxable × vat_percent / 100
             - Step 6: Calculate grand_total = taxable + vat_total
             - Step 7: Distribute VAT proportionally across items based on their contribution to subtotal
          
          3. ✅ Validation Rules:
             - Discount amount must be >= 0 (cannot be negative)
             - Discount amount cannot exceed subtotal (prevents negative taxable amount)
             - Returns 400 error with clear message if validation fails
          
          4. ✅ Backend PDF Generation Enhanced (lines 1975-2003):
             - Added discount line in PDF output between Subtotal and VAT
             - Shows as "-{discount_amount:.2f} OMR" when discount > 0
             - Discount line is conditional (only shows if discount exists)
          
          5. ✅ Precision Handling:
             - All monetary values rounded to 3 decimals (OMR currency standard)
             - Discount amount rounded to 3 decimals
             - Taxable amount rounded to 3 decimals
             - VAT total rounded to 3 decimals
             - Grand total rounded to 3 decimals
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ Discount applies to ENTIRE invoice (not per item)
          - ✅ Discount is deducted BEFORE VAT calculation
          - ✅ VAT is calculated on (subtotal - discount), not on subtotal
          - ✅ Backward compatible - invoices without discount default to 0
          - ✅ VAT distributed proportionally across items to maintain accurate line totals
          - ✅ Complete validation prevents invalid discount amounts
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Convert job card to invoice WITH discount amount
          2. Convert job card to invoice WITHOUT discount (default 0)
          3. Validation: Negative discount amount (should fail with 400)
          4. Validation: Discount > subtotal (should fail with 400)
          5. Calculation accuracy: subtotal - discount = taxable
          6. Calculation accuracy: VAT = taxable × 5% (not subtotal × 5%)
          7. Calculation accuracy: grand_total = taxable + VAT
          8. Backend PDF shows discount line when discount > 0
          9. Backend PDF hides discount line when discount = 0

          MODULE 8 IMPLEMENTED - Job Card Gold Rate with Auto-fill to Invoice.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ JobCard Model Enhanced (line 139-162):
             ADDED NEW FIELD:
             - gold_rate_at_jobcard: Optional[float] = None
             - Stores the gold rate (per gram) at time of job card creation
             - Optional field for backward compatibility
          
          2. ✅ POST /api/jobcards Enhanced:
             - Accepts gold_rate_at_jobcard in request
             - Rounds to 2 decimal precision for money
             - Stores in JobCard document
          
          3. ✅ PATCH /api/jobcards/{id} Enhanced:
             - Allows updating gold_rate_at_jobcard
             - Maintains 2 decimal precision
          
          4. ✅ POST /api/jobcards/{id}/convert-to-invoice CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT (line 1398-1408):
             Auto-fill Logic with Priority Chain:
             - Priority 1: invoice_data.metal_rate (user override from convert dialog)
             - Priority 2: jobcard.gold_rate_at_jobcard (from job card)
             - Priority 3: Default 20.0 (fallback for backward compatibility)
             
             Previous Logic (line 1404):
             - metal_rate = 20.0 (hardcoded for all items)
             
             New Logic:
             - metal_rate = invoice_data.get('metal_rate') or jobcard.get('gold_rate_at_jobcard') or 20.0
             - Ensures 2 decimal precision with round(float(metal_rate), 2)
             - Applied to ALL invoice items consistently
             - Backward compatible: existing job cards without gold rate use default 20.0
          
          Frontend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Form State Enhanced (line 29-53):
             - Added gold_rate_at_jobcard: '' to formData state initialization
             - Proper parsing with parseFloat() in handleCreateJobCard
             - Included in edit/update flow
          
          2. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Gold Rate Input Field Added (after line 555):
             - Positioned after Status field and before Notes section
             - Label: "Gold Rate (per gram) - OMR"
             - Input type: number with step="0.01" for 2 decimal precision
             - Min value: 0 (prevents negative rates)
             - Placeholder: "e.g., 20.00"
             - Helper text: "Optional: This rate will auto-fill when converting to invoice"
             - Data-testid: "gold-rate-input" for testing
          
          3. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - handleEditJobCard Enhanced (line 196-219):
             - Loads gold_rate_at_jobcard when editing existing job card
             - Populates input field with existing value
          
          4. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - handleCloseDialog Enhanced (line 237-268):
             - Resets gold_rate_at_jobcard to '' when closing dialog
             - Maintains clean state for new job cards
          
          5. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Convert Dialog Enhanced (line 741-883):
             - Added informational display showing gold rate from job card
             - Positioned between job card info and customer type selection
             - Only shows if gold_rate_at_jobcard exists
             - Display format: "💰 Gold Rate from Job Card: {rate} OMR/gram"
             - Helper text: "This rate will be auto-filled in the invoice"
             - Amber-colored card for visibility
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ gold_rate_at_jobcard is optional (backward compatible)
          - ✅ Rate stored at job card creation time (historical record)
          - ✅ Auto-fills to invoice during conversion (reduces manual entry)
          - ✅ User can override rate during conversion if needed
          - ✅ Default fallback (20.0) for existing job cards
          - ✅ Consistent rate applied to all items in invoice
          - ✅ 2 decimal precision maintained throughout
          - ✅ Visual feedback in convert dialog
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create job card WITH gold rate field (e.g., 25.50)
          2. Create job card WITHOUT gold rate field (leave empty)
          3. Edit job card and change gold rate
          4. Convert job card WITH gold rate → verify invoice items use that rate
          5. Convert job card WITHOUT gold rate → verify invoice items use default 20.0
          6. Convert dialog shows gold rate from job card correctly
          7. Existing job cards (created before Module 8) still convert correctly
          8. Gold rate field accepts decimal values (0.01 precision)
          9. Validation: negative gold rate prevented (min="0")
          10. Backend calculation uses correct priority chain
          11. All invoice items use same metal_rate consistently

          MODULE 10 IMPLEMENTED - Gold Exchange Payment Mode for Invoice Settlements.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ Enhanced POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/add-payment Endpoint (lines 1865-2260):
             
             NEW PAYMENT MODE: GOLD_EXCHANGE
             - Allows customers to use their gold balance to pay for invoices
             - Only available for saved customers (requires party_id for gold ledger tracking)
             - Walk-in customers cannot use GOLD_EXCHANGE mode
             
             Required Fields for GOLD_EXCHANGE:
             - payment_mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
             - gold_weight_grams: float (3 decimal precision) - amount of gold to use
             - rate_per_gram: float (2 decimal precision) - conversion rate
             Optional:
             - purity_entered: int (defaults to 916 - 22K gold standard)
             - notes: Optional[str]
          
          2. ✅ Auto-Calculation Logic:
             - gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram
             - Rounded to 2 decimal precision for money
             - This calculated value is used to reduce invoice balance_due
          
          3. ✅ Comprehensive Validation:
             a. Customer Type Validation:
                - Must be saved customer (customer_type = "saved")
                - Must have customer_id (not walk-in)
                - Returns 400 error for walk-in customers
             
             b. Input Validation:
                - gold_weight_grams must be > 0
                - rate_per_gram must be > 0
                - Returns 400 error with clear message if invalid
             
             c. Gold Balance Validation:
                - Queries gold_ledger to calculate customer's current gold balance
                - gold_balance = SUM(IN entries) - SUM(OUT entries)
                - Validates customer has sufficient gold (balance >= gold_weight_grams)
                - Returns 400 error with available vs required gold if insufficient
             
             d. Payment Amount Validation:
                - Validates gold_money_value doesn't exceed invoice balance_due
                - Returns 400 error if overpayment attempted
          
          4. ✅ GoldLedgerEntry Creation (Type Determination):
             Business Direction: Customer uses their gold to pay invoice
             - Type: "OUT" (shop gives/returns gold to party, or party uses their gold with shop)
             - Purpose: "exchange" (gold exchange for payment settlement)
             - Reference: Links to invoice (reference_type="invoice", reference_id=invoice_id)
             - Weight: gold_weight_grams (3 decimal precision)
             - Purity: purity_entered (defaults to 916)
             - Notes: Includes invoice number, rate, and calculation details
             - Created by: current_user.id
          
          5. ✅ Transaction Record Creation (Financial Trace):
             - transaction_type: "credit" (money coming in, even though paid in gold)
             - mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
             - account_id: "Gold Exchange" account (auto-created if doesn't exist)
             - account_name: "Gold Exchange"
             - party_id: invoice.customer_id
             - party_name: invoice.customer_name
             - amount: gold_money_value (converted money value)
             - category: "Invoice Payment"
             - reference: Links to invoice
             - notes: Detailed calculation (weight × rate = value)
             - Auto-generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN format)
          
          6. ✅ Invoice Payment Update:
             - paid_amount += gold_money_value
             - balance_due = grand_total - paid_amount (cannot go negative)
             - payment_status: "paid" if balance_due < 0.01, else "partial"
             - All updates are atomic (succeed together or fail together)
          
          7. ✅ Default Account Creation:
             - If "Gold Exchange" account doesn't exist, automatically creates it
             - account_type: "asset"
             - opening_balance: 0, current_balance: 0
             - This ensures GOLD_EXCHANGE mode always works without setup
          
          8. ✅ Audit Trail (3 Audit Logs Created):
             a. Gold Ledger Audit:
                - entity_type: "gold_ledger"
                - action: "create"
                - Details: invoice_id, gold_weight, rate, money value
             
             b. Transaction Audit:
                - entity_type: "transaction"
                - action: "create"
                - Details: invoice_id, payment_mode, gold details, amount
             
             c. Invoice Payment Audit:
                - entity_type: "invoice"
                - action: "add_payment_gold_exchange"
                - Details: gold weight, rate, value, payment amounts, gold balance before/after
          
          9. ✅ Response Structure (Enhanced for GOLD_EXCHANGE):
             Returns comprehensive details:
             - message: "Gold exchange payment added successfully"
             - payment_mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
             - gold_ledger_entry_id: UUID of created gold ledger entry
             - gold_weight_grams: Amount of gold used (3 decimals)
             - rate_per_gram: Conversion rate (2 decimals)
             - gold_money_value: Calculated payment amount (2 decimals)
             - transaction_id: UUID of created transaction
             - transaction_number: TXN-YYYY-NNNN
             - new_paid_amount: Updated total paid on invoice
             - new_balance_due: Remaining balance on invoice
             - payment_status: "paid" or "partial"
             - customer_gold_balance_remaining: Customer's gold balance after payment (3 decimals)
          
          10. ✅ Backward Compatibility:
              - All existing payment modes (Cash, Bank Transfer, Card, UPI/Online, Cheque) continue to work
              - Standard payment modes unchanged - still require amount and account_id
              - No breaking changes to existing invoice payment workflow
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ Works ONLY for saved customers (not walk-in)
          - ✅ Creates GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT) to track gold usage
          - ✅ Creates Transaction record for financial reporting
          - ✅ Reduces invoice balance_due by gold_money_value
          - ✅ Updates invoice payment_status (paid/partial) correctly
          - ✅ Validates sufficient gold balance before allowing payment
          - ✅ Prevents overpayment (gold value cannot exceed balance_due)
          - ✅ All operations are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
          - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
          - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals for gold, 2 decimals for money
          - ✅ Auto-creates "Gold Exchange" account if needed
          - ✅ Returns remaining customer gold balance for verification
          
          Financial Flow Example:
          
          Scenario: Customer has 50.500g gold with shop (IN entries), wants to pay 500 OMR invoice
          
          Step 1: Customer initiates GOLD_EXCHANGE payment:
          - gold_weight_grams: 25.000g
          - rate_per_gram: 20.00 OMR
          
          Step 2: System auto-calculates:
          - gold_money_value = 25.000 × 20.00 = 500.00 OMR
          
          Step 3: System validates:
          - Customer has 50.500g available ✅ (sufficient)
          - Payment 500.00 OMR <= invoice balance 500.00 OMR ✅ (valid)
          
          Step 4: System creates 3 atomic records:
          a. GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT, weight=25.000g) - reduces customer gold balance
          b. Transaction (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE, amount=500.00 OMR) - financial trace
          c. Invoice update (paid_amount=500.00, balance_due=0.00, status=paid)
          
          Step 5: Result:
          - Customer gold balance: 50.500g - 25.000g = 25.500g remaining
          - Invoice status: PAID
          - Complete audit trail maintained
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Create invoice for saved customer with outstanding balance
          2. Ensure customer has gold IN entries (gold balance available)
          3. Attempt GOLD_EXCHANGE payment with valid gold and rate
          4. Verify gold_money_value calculated correctly (weight × rate)
          5. Verify GoldLedgerEntry created (type=OUT, purpose=exchange)
          6. Verify Transaction record created (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE)
          7. Verify invoice paid_amount and balance_due updated correctly
          8. Verify invoice payment_status changes (paid/partial)
          9. Verify customer gold balance reduced correctly
          10. Validation: Attempt GOLD_EXCHANGE for walk-in customer (should fail with 400)
          11. Validation: Insufficient gold balance (should fail with 400)
          12. Validation: Overpayment attempt (should fail with 400)
          13. Validation: Invalid gold_weight_grams (0 or negative, should fail)
          14. Validation: Invalid rate_per_gram (0 or negative, should fail)
          15. Verify "Gold Exchange" account auto-created if doesn't exist
          16. Verify all 3 audit logs created with correct details
          17. Verify response includes all GOLD_EXCHANGE specific fields
          18. Verify precision: 3 decimals for gold, 2 decimals for money
          19. Test partial payment scenario (gold value < balance_due)
          20. Test full payment scenario (gold value = balance_due)

          Inventory CRUD operations ready for comprehensive testing.
          
          IMPLEMENTED - Complete inventory CRUD operations with UPDATE and DELETE endpoints.
          
          NEW ENDPOINTS ADDED:
          
          1. ✅ PATCH /api/inventory/headers/{header_id}:
             - Updates existing inventory header (category name)
             - Allows updating: name, is_active fields
             - Note: current_qty and current_weight are managed through stock movements only
             - Validates header exists before update
             - Creates audit log with changes
             - Returns 404 if header not found or already deleted
             - Returns 400 if no valid fields to update
          
          2. ✅ DELETE /api/inventory/headers/{header_id}:
             - Soft deletes an inventory header
             - Validates header exists before deletion
             - CRITICAL VALIDATION: Prevents deletion if header has current stock
             - Error message shows current qty and weight if stock exists
             - Creates audit log with header name
             - Preserves audit trail (does not affect existing stock movements)
             - Returns 404 if header not found or already deleted
          
          3. ✅ DELETE /api/inventory/movements/{movement_id}:
             - Deletes a stock movement and reverses its effect on inventory
             - CRITICAL PROTECTION: Cannot delete movements linked to invoices or purchases
             - Soft deletes the movement (is_deleted = true)
             - Automatically reverses stock changes in header (qty and weight)
             - Validates reversal won't make stock negative
             - Creates detailed audit log with movement details
             - Returns reversed qty and weight in response
             - Maintains financial integrity by blocking deletion of transactional movements
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ Inventory headers can only be updated (name/status), not qty/weight directly
          - ✅ Headers with stock cannot be deleted (data integrity)
          - ✅ Stock movements linked to invoices/purchases cannot be deleted (audit trail)
          - ✅ Manual stock movements can be deleted if no downstream impact
          - ✅ All deletions are soft deletes (preserves data)
          - ✅ Stock reversal validated to prevent negative stock
          - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained for all operations
          
          READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Update inventory header name successfully
          2. Update inventory header is_active status
          3. Attempt to update non-existent header (should return 404)
          4. Delete inventory header with zero stock (should succeed)
          5. Attempt to delete header with stock (should fail with 400 and show current stock)
          6. Delete manual stock movement (should succeed and reverse stock)
          7. Attempt to delete invoice-linked movement (should fail with 400)
          8. Attempt to delete purchase-linked movement (should fail with 400)
          9. Verify stock reversal calculations are accurate
          10. Verify all audit logs created correctly
          11. Attempt to delete movement that would cause negative stock (should fail)

          ✅ DAILY CLOSING AUTO-CALCULATION FEATURE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED
          
          Implementation Summary:
          
          1. ✅ ENHANCED DailyClosing Model (line 235):
             - Made calculated fields Optional with defaults to support auto-calculation
             - opening_cash: Optional[float] = 0.0
             - total_credit: Optional[float] = 0.0
             - total_debit: Optional[float] = 0.0
             - expected_closing: Optional[float] = 0.0
             - difference: Optional[float] = 0.0
             - All other fields remain required (date, actual_closing, closed_by)
          
          2. ✅ ENHANCED POST /api/daily-closings Endpoint (lines 2871-2942):
             - Now supports creating records with minimal data (date + actual_closing)
             - Auto-calculates missing fields if not provided:
               * Queries previous day's closing for opening_cash
               * Aggregates transactions for the date (credit/debit totals)
               * Calculates expected_closing = opening_cash + credit - debit
               * Calculates difference = actual_closing - expected_closing
             - All calculations use 3 decimal precision (OMR standard)
             - Proper error handling with descriptive messages
          
          3. ✅ GET /api/daily-closings/calculate/{date} Endpoint (lines 2944-3002):
             - Returns auto-calculated values WITHOUT creating a record
             - Accepts date in YYYY-MM-DD format
             - Returns comprehensive response:
               * opening_cash (from previous day's actual_closing or 0.0)
               * total_credit, total_debit (aggregated from transactions)
               * expected_closing (calculated)
               * transaction_count, credit_count, debit_count
               * has_previous_closing (boolean flag)
             - Validates date format (400 error for invalid dates)
             - 3 decimal precision for all money values
          
          4. ✅ NEW PATCH /api/daily-closings/{id} Endpoint (lines 3004-3047):
             - Update existing daily closing records
             - Can update: actual_closing, notes, is_locked
             - Auto-recalculates difference when actual_closing changes
             - Prevents updates to locked records (403 error)
             - 404 error for non-existent records
             - Creates audit log for all updates
          
          5. ✅ GET /api/daily-closings Endpoint (lines 2866-2869):
             - Lists all daily closings sorted by date descending
             - Returns complete records with all calculated fields
          
          Key Features Implemented:
          - ✅ First day handling: opening_cash = 0.0 when no previous closing exists
          - ✅ Previous closing lookup: Uses actual_closing from previous day
          - ✅ Transaction aggregation: Sums credit/debit by type for the date
          - ✅ Empty day handling: Returns zeros when no transactions
          - ✅ Date validation: Proper error for invalid date formats
          - ✅ Precision: 3 decimals for all money values (OMR standard)
          - ✅ Locked record protection: Prevents editing finalized closings
          - ✅ Audit trail: Logs all create/update operations
          - ✅ Difference calculation: actual_closing - expected_closing
          
          Testing Results: 100% SUCCESS (8/8 tests passed):
          ✅ Authentication working
          ✅ Create previous closing record (setup)
          ✅ Create transactions for testing (setup)
          ✅ Calculate WITH previous closing: opening=1000.5, credit=1250.625, debit=350.125, expected=1901.0
          ✅ Calculate FIRST day (no previous): opening=0.0, credit=300.0, debit=100.0, expected=200.0
          ✅ Calculate empty day: all zeros
          ✅ Invalid date format rejected with 400 error
          ✅ Precision verified: all values have 3 decimal places
          ✅ PATCH endpoint working: updates actual_closing and auto-recalculates difference
          
          PRODUCTION READY - All endpoints fully functional with comprehensive validation and error handling.

        comment: "CRITICAL FIX - Added missing invoice finalization UI that was preventing users from finalizing invoices. Changes: (1) Added invoice status badge column showing 'Draft' (blue) or 'Finalized' (green with lock icon). (2) Added 'Finalize' button for draft invoices with confirmation dialog explaining all consequences (stock deduction, invoice lock, job card lock, ledger entry creation). (3) Separated invoice status from payment status for clarity. (4) Added informational card explaining Draft vs Finalized workflow. (5) Button shows loading state while finalizing and is disabled during process. (6) Finalized invoices only show Print button, draft invoices show both Finalize and Print buttons. This completes the full invoice state management implementation - backend was correct but frontend lacked the UI to trigger finalization, meaning all invoices stayed in draft state forever with no stock deduction happening. Now users can properly finalize invoices through a clear, safe workflow. READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify: (a) Draft invoices display correctly with status badge, (b) Finalize button appears and works, (c) Confirmation dialog shows, (d) Status updates to Finalized after confirmation, (e) Finalize button disappears for finalized invoices, (f) Stock movements are created, (g) Job cards get locked, (h) Customer ledger entries are created."

Locked job cards display 'Locked' badge instead. Updated dialog title to show 'Edit Job Card' vs 'Create New Job Card' and button text changes to 'Update Job Card' vs 'Create Job Card'. (2) CATEGORY DROPDOWN: Replaced plain text Input field with Select dropdown for item categories. Now loads inventory headers from GET /api/inventory/headers and populates dropdown with available categories. Users can select from existing inventory categories (e.g., Gold 24K, Gold 22K, Silver, etc.) instead of manually typing. Default category uses first inventory header if available, fallback to 'Chain'. Both issues are now fully functional and ready for testing."

          MODULE 7 FRONTEND IMPLEMENTED - Invoice Discount UI with Print View Integration.
          
          Frontend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ JobCardsPage.js - Convert to Invoice Dialog Enhanced (lines 126-175, 823-844):
             ADDED DISCOUNT INPUT FIELD:
             - New discount_amount input field in convert dialog (after customer details)
             - Input type: number with step="0.001" for 3 decimal precision
             - Minimum value: 0 (enforced by HTML5 validation)
             - Placeholder: "0.000"
             - Helper text: "Optional: Enter discount amount to be applied before VAT calculation"
             - Field appears for BOTH saved and walk-in customers
          
          2. ✅ Convert Dialog State Management:
             - Added discount_amount to convertData state initialization (default: 0)
             - Initialize discount_amount when opening convert dialog for both customer types
             - handleConfirmConvert sends discount_amount to backend API:
               * Parses value with parseFloat(convertData.discount_amount) || 0
               * Ensures 0 is sent if field is empty or invalid
          
          3. ✅ InvoicesPage.js - Print PDF Enhanced (lines 111-135):
             ADDED DISCOUNT LINE IN PDF:
             - Conditional display: Only shows discount line if discount_amount > 0
             - Position: Between Subtotal and VAT Total (as per standard invoice format)
             - Format: "Discount: -{discount_amount:.3f} OMR" (negative sign prefix)
             - Uses dynamic positioning (currentY variable) to handle conditional spacing
             - Maintains proper alignment with other totals
          
          4. ✅ Print Layout Flow:
             Standard invoice totals section now follows this order:
             1. Subtotal (always shown)
             2. Discount (conditionally shown if > 0)
             3. VAT Total (always shown)
             4. Grand Total (always shown, bold)
             5. Balance Due (always shown, color-coded)
             6. Payment Status (always shown)
          
          UI/UX Features:
          - ✅ Clear labeling: "Discount Amount (OMR)"
          - ✅ 3 decimal precision matches backend and OMR currency standard
          - ✅ Optional field (not required) - defaults to 0 if empty
          - ✅ Positioned logically in convert dialog (after customer selection)
          - ✅ Helper text explains when discount is applied (before VAT)
          - ✅ Print view clearly shows discount as deduction (negative sign)
          - ✅ Print view spacing adjusts dynamically based on discount presence
          
          READY FOR UI TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Convert dialog shows discount input field
          2. Discount field accepts decimal values (0.000 format)
          3. Discount field prevents negative values (HTML5 validation)
          4. Converting without entering discount defaults to 0
          5. Converting with discount value passes it to backend
          6. Print PDF shows discount line when discount > 0
          7. Print PDF hides discount line when discount = 0
          8. Print PDF alignment and spacing is correct
          9. Discount appears as negative value in print view
        comment: "CONFIRMED WORKING - User tested and confirmed all fixes are working correctly: (1) Login issue resolved with admin user creation. (2) Edit/Delete buttons visible and functional for unlocked job cards. (3) Category dropdown populated from inventory headers. (4) Convert to Invoice button restored for all completed job cards (original behavior maintained). All features working as expected."

          ENHANCED - Added Edit & Lock/Unlock Functionality for Daily Closings
          
          Frontend Implementation (DailyClosingPage.js):
          
          1. ✅ Edit Functionality (Available to All Authenticated Users):
             - Added Edit button (pencil icon) in Actions column for unlocked closings
             - Edit button only visible for unlocked closings (locked closings cannot be edited)
             - Created Edit Dialog with:
               * Read-only display of date and expected closing
               * Editable actual_closing field (number input with 3 decimal precision)
               * Editable notes field (optional)
               * Real-time difference calculation display with color coding
               * Warning display if closing is locked (safety check)
             - handleEdit function to open edit dialog with closing data
             - handleUpdateClosing function calls PATCH /api/daily-closings/{id}
             - Success/error toast notifications
             - Auto-refresh closings list after successful update
          
          2. ✅ Lock/Unlock Functionality (Admin Only):
             - Added Lock/Unlock button in Actions column (visible only to admins)
             - Lock icon shown for unlocked closings (green color)
             - Unlock icon shown for locked closings (red color)
             - handleToggleLock function with admin role check
             - Role validation: only users with role='admin' can lock/unlock
             - Non-admin users receive error toast if attempting to lock/unlock
             - Toggles is_locked status via PATCH /api/daily-closings/{id}
             - Success/error toast notifications
             - Auto-refresh closings list after successful toggle
          
          3. ✅ UI/UX Enhancements:
             - Added Actions column to closings table
             - Buttons use lucide-react icons: Edit, Lock, Unlock, AlertCircle
             - Status badges show Locked (red) or Unlocked (green) with icons
             - Edit dialog shows calculated difference with color coding:
               * Green: Perfect match (0 difference)
               * Yellow: Minor difference (±10 OMR or less)
               * Red: Significant difference (>10 OMR)
             - Responsive button layout in Actions column
             - Data-testid attributes for testing
          
          4. ✅ Backend Integration:
             - Uses existing PATCH /api/daily-closings/{id} endpoint
             - Backend already prevents editing locked closings (403 error)
             - Backend auto-recalculates difference when actual_closing updated
             - Full audit trail maintained via backend audit logs
          
          Key Business Rules Implemented:
          - ✅ Anyone can edit unlocked closings (all authenticated users)
          - ✅ Only admins can lock/unlock closings (role-based access control)
          - ✅ Locked closings cannot be edited (UI enforced + backend protected)
          - ✅ Edit button hidden for locked closings (clear visual feedback)
          - ✅ Lock/Unlock button only visible to admins (role check)
          - ✅ Real-time difference calculation in edit dialog
          - ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback via toasts
          - ✅ Auto-refresh ensures data consistency after operations
          
          READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify:
          1. Non-admin user can edit unlocked closings successfully
          2. Non-admin user cannot see Lock/Unlock buttons
          3. Admin user can see Lock/Unlock buttons
          4. Admin user can lock an unlocked closing
          5. Admin user can unlock a locked closing
          6. Edit button disappears for locked closings
          7. Attempting to edit locked closing shows error (backend protection)
          8. Difference calculation updates correctly in edit dialog
          9. Toast notifications work for all operations
          10. Closings list refreshes after edit/lock operations

        comment: "IMPLEMENTED - Complete walk-in vs saved customer handling UI. JobCardsPage changes: (1) Updated handleConvertToInvoice to show customer type selection dialog before conversion. (2) Added convertData state for customer type, customer selection, walk-in name/phone. (3) Created Convert Dialog with radio buttons for customer type selection. For 'Saved Customer': Shows party dropdown with existing customers, displays info about ledger tracking and outstanding. For 'Walk-in Customer': Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional), displays warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties and full payment is recommended. (4) Updated Convert to Invoice button to pass entire jobcard object instead of just ID. InvoicesPage changes: (1) Added payment dialog functionality with accounts loading. (2) Updated invoice table to show 'Walk-in' badge for walk-in customers with walk_in_name display. (3) Added 'Add Payment' button for all invoices with balance_due > 0. (4) Created payment dialog with: amount input (default to full balance), payment mode dropdown (Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque), account selection (where money goes), notes field. Shows walk-in warning for partial payments. (5) handleAddPayment function calls POST /api/invoices/{id}/add-payment and shows warning toast for walk-in partial payments.

        comment: "CRITICAL FIX - Added Toggle Option in Job Card Creation Form: User reported missing toggle to select between walk-in and saved customers in job card creation. ROOT CAUSE: Customer type selection was only available during invoice conversion, not during job card creation itself. FIX IMPLEMENTED: (1) Added prominent Customer Type radio button section at the top of job card form with 'Saved Customer' and 'Walk-in Customer' options. (2) Dynamic form fields based on selection: For Saved Customer - Shows party dropdown with ledger tracking info message. For Walk-in Customer - Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional) with warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties. (3) Updated job card table to display walk-in badge next to customer name for easy identification. (4) Enhanced convert-to-invoice dialog to show job card's original customer type and pre-populate fields accordingly. (5) Form validation ensures: saved customers must select from parties, walk-in customers must enter name. RESULT: Users now have clear, upfront control over customer handling from job card creation. Walk-in vs saved distinction is visible throughout the entire workflow. Backend already supported these fields (customer_type, walk_in_name, walk_in_phone). Payment tracking creates Transaction records for all payments as required. Ready for testing."

         - Returns 8 reports with proper metadata
         - Categories: financial, inventory, parties, sales, purchases
         - All endpoints validated and working
      
      2. 🔍 Inventory CRUD Operations - Implemented but needs verification testing:
         - PATCH /api/inventory/headers/{header_id} - Update header name/status (lines 464-506)
         - DELETE /api/inventory/headers/{header_id} - Soft delete with stock validation (lines 508-542)
         - DELETE /api/inventory/movements/{movement_id} - Delete movement with reversal (lines 596-661)

      MODULE 8/10 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - JobCard Gold Rate Field + Auto-fill Invoice Rate
      
      Backend Changes:
      - ✅ Added gold_rate_at_jobcard field to JobCard model (Optional[float], 2 decimal precision)
      - ✅ POST /api/jobcards accepts and stores gold_rate_at_jobcard
      - ✅ PATCH /api/jobcards/{id} allows updating gold_rate_at_jobcard
      - ✅ CRITICAL: convert_jobcard_to_invoice now uses priority chain:
        * Priority 1: invoice_data.metal_rate (user override)
        * Priority 2: jobcard.gold_rate_at_jobcard (auto-fill from job card)
        * Priority 3: Default 20.0 (backward compatibility fallback)
      - ✅ Previous hardcoded metal_rate = 20.0 replaced with dynamic rate selection
      - ✅ Rate applied consistently to ALL invoice items
      
      Frontend Changes:
      - ✅ Added "Gold Rate (per gram) - OMR" input field in job card form
      - ✅ Field positioned after Status and before Notes section
      - ✅ Input validation: type="number", step="0.01", min="0"
      - ✅ Helper text explains: "This rate will auto-fill when converting to invoice"
      - ✅ formData state includes gold_rate_at_jobcard with proper parsing
      - ✅ handleEditJobCard loads existing gold rate for editing
      - ✅ handleCloseDialog resets gold rate on form close
      - ✅ Convert dialog enhanced with gold rate display:
        * Shows amber-colored info card when job card has gold rate
        * Format: "💰 Gold Rate from Job Card: {rate} OMR/gram"
        * Positioned between job card info and customer type selection
      
      Key Features:
      - ✅ Backward compatible: optional field, existing job cards work fine
      - ✅ Historical record: rate stored at job card creation time
      - ✅ Auto-fill reduces manual data entry during conversion
      - ✅ Visual feedback in convert dialog for transparency
      - ✅ User can override if needed (priority chain supports it)
      - ✅ 2 decimal precision maintained throughout
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
      1. Create job card WITH gold rate (e.g., 25.50) → verify stored correctly
      2. Create job card WITHOUT gold rate → verify works with default
      3. Edit job card and change gold rate → verify update works
      4. Convert job card WITH gold rate → verify invoice items use that rate
      5. Convert job card WITHOUT gold rate → verify default 20.0 used
      6. Convert dialog display → verify gold rate shown correctly
      7. Existing job cards (before Module 8) → verify backward compatibility
      8. Field validation → verify negative rates prevented (min="0")
      9. Decimal precision → verify accepts 0.01 step values
      10. Priority chain → verify invoice_data override works if needed

    message: "CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC FIX IMPLEMENTED: Invoice state management now properly implemented. Invoices are created in 'draft' status with NO stock deduction. Stock OUT movements ONLY happen when invoice is explicitly finalized via new POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize endpoint. Finalized invoices are immutable (cannot be edited or deleted). This ensures financial integrity and prevents premature inventory deduction. READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - please test all invoice workflows: create draft, edit draft, finalize, attempt to edit finalized (should fail), verify stock movements only happen on finalization."

      FEATURE COMPLETE - Daily Closing Edit & Lock/Unlock Functionality
      
      User Request: "Allow editing unlocked closings by anyone"
      
      Implementation Summary:
      
      ✅ FRONTEND ENHANCEMENTS (DailyClosingPage.js):
      1. Edit Functionality - Available to ALL authenticated users:
         - Edit button added in Actions column (only for unlocked closings)
         - Edit dialog with actual_closing and notes fields
         - Real-time difference calculation with color-coded display
         - PATCH /api/daily-closings/{id} integration
         - Success/error notifications
      
      2. Lock/Unlock Functionality - ADMIN ONLY:
         - Lock/Unlock button in Actions column (admin role check)
         - Toggle is_locked status
         - Visual feedback with colored icons (green=unlocked, red=locked)
         - Role-based access control prevents non-admins from locking
      
      3. UI/UX Improvements:
         - Actions column added to table
         - Status badges (Locked/Unlocked with icons)
         - Edit button hidden for locked closings
         - Lock/Unlock button only visible to admins
         - Color-coded difference calculation
      
      ✅ BACKEND (Already Working):
      - PATCH /api/daily-closings/{id} endpoint prevents editing locked records
      - Auto-recalculates difference when actual_closing changes
      - Audit trail maintained
      - Role validation not enforced on backend (frontend handles lock/unlock)
      
      Key Features:
      - ✅ Anyone can edit unlocked closings (no admin required)
      - ✅ Only admins can lock/unlock closings (role check)
      - ✅ Locked closings protected from editing (UI + backend)
      - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
      - ✅ Real-time validation and feedback
      
      READY FOR USER TESTING:
      The daily closing page now allows all users to edit unlocked closings,
      while restricting lock/unlock operations to admins only. This provides
      flexibility for corrections while maintaining data integrity through
      the locking mechanism.

    message: "🎯 COMPREHENSIVE INVOICE FINALIZATION WORKFLOW TESTING COMPLETED - PERFECT SUCCESS RATE (100%): Conducted detailed testing of all 7 critical invoice finalization scenarios as specifically requested in the review. ✅ TEST 1: Draft Invoice Creation - NO Stock Deduction: Verified draft invoices created with status='draft', confirmed NO stock movements exist in stock_movements collection, invoices retrievable via GET /api/invoices/{id}. ✅ TEST 2: Invoice Finalization - Stock Deduction Happens: Verified POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize returns 200 status, invoice status changes to 'finalized', finalized_at and finalized_by fields populated, stock movements created with movement_type='Stock OUT', all qty_delta and weight_delta values are NEGATIVE, movements reference invoice correctly (reference_type='invoice', reference_id=invoice_id). ✅ TEST 3: Finalized Invoice Cannot Be Edited: PATCH /api/invoices/{id} returns 400 status with immutability error message. ✅ TEST 4: Finalized Invoice Cannot Be Deleted: DELETE /api/invoices/{id} returns 400 status with finalized invoice protection error. ✅ TEST 5: Cannot Re-Finalize: POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize on already finalized invoice returns 400 with 'Invoice is already finalized' message, no duplicate stock movements created. ✅ TEST 6: Job Card Locking: Job cards properly locked (locked=True, locked_at populated, locked_by populated, status='invoiced'), admin override works with warning messages. ✅ TEST 7: Customer Ledger Entry: Transaction records created with party_id=customer_id, amount=grand_total, category='Sales Invoice', transaction_number follows TXN-YYYY-NNNN format, customer outstanding balance updated. 🔥 CRITICAL VERIFICATION: Stock deduction happens ATOMICALLY ONLY when invoice is finalized (not on creation), maintaining complete financial integrity. All test scenarios from review request PASSED. Invoice finalization workflow is fully functional and secure."

    message: "NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTED - Walk-in vs Saved Customer Handling: (1) Backend - Added customer_type field to Invoice model with walk_in_name/walk_in_phone fields. Updated convert_jobcard_to_invoice to accept customer type and validate accordingly. Created POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/add-payment endpoint that accepts amount, payment_mode, account_id, notes. All payments now create Transaction records for finance tracking. For saved customers: links to party_id. For walk-in: party_id=None with '(Walk-in)' suffix in party_name. Returns warning flag for walk-in partial payments. (2) Frontend - JobCardsPage: Added customer type selection dialog before invoice conversion with radio buttons for Saved/Walk-in. Shows party dropdown for saved, name/phone inputs for walk-in with appropriate warnings. InvoicesPage: Added 'Add Payment' button for invoices with balance. Payment dialog includes amount, payment mode dropdown (Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque), account selection, notes. Shows walk-in warning for partial payments. Displays 'Walk-in' badge in invoice table. READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Need to verify: (a) Job card to invoice conversion with both customer types, (b) Walk-in customers NOT saved in Parties, (c) Payment collection creates Transaction records, (d) Walk-in partial payment warnings, (e) Login still working with admin/admin123."

    message: "✅ REPORTS & FILTERS FEATURE COMPLETE - Production-Ready Implementation: Implemented comprehensive reports & filters system per requirements. BACKEND (Phase 1): (1) ✅ Added due_date field to Invoice model for overdue calculations (defaults to invoice_date). (2) ✅ Created Outstanding Report endpoint GET /api/reports/outstanding with: party-wise outstanding tracking, customer due vs vendor payable breakdown, overdue buckets (0-7, 8-30, 31+ days), last invoice/payment dates, filters for party_id, party_type, date_range. (3) ✅ Enhanced Financial Summary endpoint with: cash_balance (sum of cash accounts), bank_balance (sum of bank accounts), net_flow (credit - debit), daily_closing_difference (actual - expected). (4) ✅ Added global filters to all report view endpoints: party_id filter, sort_by parameter (date_asc, date_desc, amount_desc, outstanding_desc). (5) ✅ Implemented 5 PDF export endpoints: /reports/outstanding-pdf, /reports/invoices-pdf, /reports/parties-pdf, /reports/transactions-pdf, /reports/inventory-pdf - All using tabular format with A4 layout, header, summary, table, proper styling.

      ✅ MODULE 7/10 - INVOICE DISCOUNT (AMOUNT BASED) IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
      
      Implemented comprehensive invoice discount feature with amount-based discounts and proper VAT recalculation.
      
      BACKEND CHANGES:
      1. ✅ Invoice Model Enhancement:
         - Added discount_amount field (float, 3 decimal precision, default 0.0)
         - Backward compatible - existing invoices default to 0 discount
      
      2. ✅ Calculation Formula Updated (convert_jobcard_to_invoice):
         - Step 1: Calculate subtotal = sum(gold_value + making_value)
         - Step 2: Apply discount = subtotal - discount_amount
         - Step 3: Calculate taxable = subtotal - discount
         - Step 4: Calculate VAT = taxable × 5% (NOT subtotal × 5%)
         - Step 5: Calculate grand_total = taxable + VAT
         - VAT is distributed proportionally across items
      
      3. ✅ Validation Rules:
         - Discount amount must be >= 0 (prevents negative discounts)
         - Discount amount cannot exceed subtotal (prevents negative taxable)
         - Clear 400 error messages for validation failures
      
      4. ✅ Backend PDF Enhanced:
         - Shows discount line between Subtotal and VAT when discount > 0
         - Format: "Discount: -{amount:.2f} OMR"
         - Dynamic spacing adjusts based on discount presence
      
      FRONTEND CHANGES:
      1. ✅ JobCardsPage - Convert to Invoice Dialog:
         - Added discount_amount input field (number, step 0.001)
         - Positioned after customer details, before action buttons
         - Helper text: "Optional: Enter discount amount to be applied before VAT calculation"
         - Defaults to 0 if not entered
      
      2. ✅ InvoicesPage - Print PDF:
         - Shows discount line in totals section when discount > 0
         - Proper order: Subtotal → Discount → VAT → Grand Total → Balance Due
         - Discount appears as negative value with minus sign prefix
      
      BUSINESS LOGIC:
      - ✅ Discount applies to ENTIRE invoice (not per item)
      - ✅ Discount deducted BEFORE VAT calculation
      - ✅ VAT calculated on (subtotal - discount), maintaining tax compliance
      - ✅ All monetary values maintain 3 decimal precision (OMR standard)
      - ✅ Backward compatible with existing invoices
      
      READY FOR TESTING - Test scenarios:
      1. Convert job card to invoice WITH discount (e.g., 10.500 OMR)
      2. Convert job card to invoice WITHOUT discount (default 0)
      3. Test validation: negative discount (should fail)
      4. Test validation: discount > subtotal (should fail)
      5. Verify calculation: VAT = (subtotal - discount) × 5%
      6. Verify print PDF shows discount line correctly
      7. Verify print PDF hides discount line when discount = 0
      8. Verify grand_total = (subtotal - discount) + VAT

      🎯 API COMPLETENESS - INVENTORY CRUD OPERATIONS COMPLETE
      
      Implemented missing UPDATE and DELETE endpoints for complete inventory CRUD functionality.
      
      IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
      
      1. ✅ PATCH /api/inventory/headers/{header_id}:
         - Updates inventory header (category name and active status)
         - Validates header exists before update
         - Only allows updating name and is_active fields
         - Note: qty/weight managed through stock movements
         - Creates audit log with changes
         - Returns updated header object
      
      2. ✅ DELETE /api/inventory/headers/{header_id}:
         - Soft deletes inventory header
         - CRITICAL VALIDATION: Cannot delete headers with stock
         - Shows current qty/weight in error if stock exists
         - Preserves audit trail (movements unchanged)
         - Creates audit log
      
      3. ✅ DELETE /api/inventory/movements/{movement_id}:
         - Deletes stock movement and reverses inventory effect
         - PROTECTION: Cannot delete invoice/purchase-linked movements
         - Automatically reverses stock in header
         - Validates reversal won't cause negative stock
         - Soft delete with audit log
         - Returns reversed qty/weight
      
      COMPLETE INVENTORY API ENDPOINTS NOW AVAILABLE:
      - ✅ GET /api/inventory/headers - List all categories
      - ✅ POST /api/inventory/headers - Create new category
      - ✅ PATCH /api/inventory/headers/{id} - Update category (NEW)
      - ✅ DELETE /api/inventory/headers/{id} - Delete category (NEW)
      - ✅ GET /api/inventory/movements - List movements
      - ✅ POST /api/inventory/movements - Create movement
      - ✅ DELETE /api/inventory/movements/{id} - Delete movement (NEW)
      - ✅ GET /api/inventory/stock-totals - Get totals
      - ✅ GET /api/inventory - Simplified listing
      
      BUSINESS RULES ENFORCED:
      - ✅ Headers with stock cannot be deleted (data integrity)
      - ✅ Transactional movements (invoice/purchase) cannot be deleted (audit compliance)
      - ✅ Manual movements can be deleted with stock reversal
      - ✅ All operations maintain audit trail
      - ✅ Negative stock prevented through validation
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - Backend is production-ready.

      🎯 MODULE 3/10 - PURCHASES MODULE IMPLEMENTED (Stock IN + Vendor Payable)
      
      Complete vendor purchase tracking system with draft/finalized workflow, stock management, and vendor payable accounting.
      
      BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
      
      1. ✅ Purchase Model Created (lines 277-298):
         - Complete draft/finalized workflow (status field)
         - Vendor validation (vendor_party_id must be vendor type)
         - Dual purity tracking: entered_purity (informational) + valuation_purity_fixed (always 916 for calculations)
         - Financial fields: weight_grams (3 decimals), rate_per_gram (2 decimals), amount_total (2 decimals)
         - Lock mechanism for finalized purchases (locked, locked_at, locked_by)
         - Complete audit trail (created_at, created_by, finalized_at, finalized_by)
         - Soft delete support (is_deleted, deleted_at, deleted_by)
      
      2. ✅ POST /api/purchases - Create Draft Purchase:
         - Validates vendor_party_id exists and is vendor type (not customer)
         - Enforces proper precision (3 decimals for weight, 2 for money)
         - Forces valuation_purity_fixed = 916 for all purchases
         - Creates audit log
      
      3. ✅ GET /api/purchases - Retrieve Purchases:
         - Filter by vendor_party_id (optional)
         - Filter by date range: start_date, end_date (optional)
         - Filter by status: draft/finalized (optional)
         - Sorted by date descending
      
      4. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} - Edit Draft Purchase:
         - Only draft purchases can be edited (finalized purchases rejected with 400)
         - Validates vendor if changed
         - Enforces precision on all numeric updates
         - Creates audit log
      
      5. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize - CRITICAL ATOMIC OPERATIONS:
         
         a. UPDATE PURCHASE STATUS:
            - status = "finalized"
            - finalized_at, finalized_by recorded
            - locked = True (prevents further edits)
            - locked_at, locked_by recorded
         
         b. CREATE STOCK IN MOVEMENT:
            - Finds/creates inventory header for 916 purity (Gold 22K)
            - Creates StockMovement with positive values (adding stock)
            - Uses valuation_purity_fixed (916) NOT entered_purity
            - Links to purchase via reference_type/reference_id
            - Updates inventory header current_qty and current_weight
         
         c. CREATE VENDOR PAYABLE TRANSACTION:
            - Auto-generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN)
            - Creates Transaction with transaction_type = "credit" (we owe vendor)
            - Links to vendor party
            - Links to purchase via reference_type/reference_id
            - Category = "Purchase"
         
         d. CREATE AUDIT LOG:
            - Records all IDs (purchase, stock movement, transaction)
            - Records weight_added, purity_used, vendor_payable_amount
         
         e. RETURN COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE:
            - All IDs for verification
            - Success message
      
      KEY BUSINESS RULES IMPLEMENTED:
      - ✅ Entered purity stored as vendor claimed (e.g., 999, 995) for reference
      - ✅ Valuation purity ALWAYS 916 for stock calculations and accounting
      - ✅ Only draft purchases can be edited (finalized are immutable)
      - ✅ Stock IN adds to inventory at 916 purity (22K gold)
      - ✅ Vendor payable created as credit transaction (liability)
      - ✅ All finalization operations are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
      - ✅ Complete audit trail maintained
      - ✅ Proper precision enforced (3 decimals weight, 2 decimals money)
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING:
      
      Test Scenarios Required:
      1. ✅ Create draft purchase - verify vendor validation, precision rounding, defaults
      2. ✅ Edit draft purchase - verify updates work, validation applied
      3. ✅ Attempt to edit finalized purchase - must fail with 400 and clear error
      4. ✅ Finalize purchase - verify all 5 atomic operations:
         - Purchase status = finalized, locked = True
         - Stock IN movement created with 916 purity (not entered purity)
         - Inventory header current stock increased correctly
         - Vendor payable transaction created as credit with correct amount
         - Audit log created with all details
      5. ✅ Attempt to re-finalize - must fail with 400
      6. ✅ Filter purchases - by vendor, date range, status
      7. ✅ Verify entered_purity stored but 916 used for calculations
      8. ✅ Verify precision - weights at 3 decimals, amounts at 2 decimals
      
      Similar to Invoice finalization which is 100% working. This follows the exact same proven pattern.

      🎯 MODULE 4/10 - PURCHASE PAYMENTS + GOLD SETTLEMENT IMPLEMENTED
      
      Enhanced the Purchases Module with comprehensive payment tracking and gold settlement options for flexible vendor payment workflows.
      
      BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
      
      1. ✅ Purchase Model Enhanced with 6 NEW fields:
         - paid_amount_money (float, 2 decimals, default 0.0)
         - balance_due_money (float, 2 decimals, auto-calculated)
         - payment_mode (Optional: Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque)
         - account_id (Optional: payment account reference)
         - advance_in_gold_grams (Optional, 3 decimals: gold we gave vendor previously)
         - exchange_in_gold_grams (Optional, 3 decimals: gold from vendor during purchase)
      
      2. ✅ POST /api/purchases Enhanced:
         - Accepts payment and gold settlement fields
         - Auto-calculates balance_due_money = amount_total - paid_amount_money
         - Validates account exists if payment made
         - Maintains precision: 3 decimals gold, 2 decimals money
      
      3. ✅ PATCH /api/purchases/{id} Enhanced:
         - Allows updating payment/gold fields (draft only)
         - Recalculates balance_due_money on changes
         - Validates account when payment amount changes
      
      4. ✅ POST /api/purchases/{id}/finalize CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT:
         Now intelligently creates UP TO 8 atomic operations based on settlement method:
         
         a. Update purchase status → always
         b. Create Stock IN movement → always
         c. Create DEBIT transaction → IF paid_amount_money > 0
         d. Create GoldLedger OUT → IF advance_in_gold_grams > 0
         e. Create GoldLedger IN → IF exchange_in_gold_grams > 0
         f. Create CREDIT vendor payable → IF balance_due_money > 0
         g. Create audit log → always
         h. Return comprehensive response → always
      
      KEY FEATURES:
      - ✅ Flexible settlement: cash, gold, or mixed
      - ✅ Payment creates DEBIT transaction (reduces our account)
      - ✅ Advance gold creates OUT entry (settles vendor's advance)
      - ✅ Exchange gold creates IN entry (vendor gives us gold)
      - ✅ Vendor payable ONLY for remaining balance_due_money
      - ✅ All operations remain atomic (succeed/fail together)
      - ✅ Complete audit trail for all settlement methods
      - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals gold, 2 decimals money
      
      SETTLEMENT EXAMPLES:
      
      Example 1: Full Cash Payment
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Paid: 1000 OMR, Balance: 0 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + DEBIT(1000) + NO vendor payable
      
      Example 2: Partial Payment
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Paid: 600 OMR, Balance: 400 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + DEBIT(600) + CREDIT(400)
      
      Example 3: Gold Advance Settlement
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Advance Gold: 25.5g, Balance: 1000 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + GoldLedger OUT(25.5g) + CREDIT(1000)
      - Note: Gold tracked separately, doesn't reduce money balance
      
      Example 4: Mixed Settlement
      - Total: 1000 OMR, Paid: 400 OMR, Advance: 10.25g, Exchange: 5.125g, Balance: 600 OMR
      - Creates: Stock IN + DEBIT(400) + GoldLedger OUT(10.25g) + GoldLedger IN(5.125g) + CREDIT(600)
      
      READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING:
      
      Critical Test Scenarios:
      1. Create purchase with payment fields → verify balance auto-calculation
      2. Create purchase with gold settlement → verify precision (3 decimals)
      3. Finalize with ONLY payment → verify DEBIT created, NO vendor payable if balance=0
      4. Finalize with ONLY advance gold → verify GoldLedger OUT created
      5. Finalize with ONLY exchange gold → verify GoldLedger IN created
      6. Finalize with mixed settlement → verify all transactions/entries created
      7. Verify vendor payable uses balance_due_money (not amount_total)
      8. Verify all IDs returned in finalize response
      9. Edit draft purchase → verify balance recalculated
      10. Verify account validation when paid_amount_money > 0
      
      This module provides complete flexibility in how vendors are paid - cash, gold settlements, or any combination thereof.

          PURCHASE HISTORY REPORT IMPLEMENTED - Complete purchase history reporting for finalized purchases only.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ GET /api/reports/purchase-history Endpoint (lines 3540-3652):
             Query Parameters:
             - date_from: Optional date filter (start of range)
             - date_to: Optional date filter (end of range)
             - vendor_id: Optional vendor filter (or "all" for all vendors)
             - search: Optional search string for vendor name, phone, or description
             
             Critical Business Logic:
             - ONLY returns purchases with status = "finalized"
             - Fetches vendor name and phone from parties collection
             - Handles vendor lookup with proper error handling
             
             Data Returned:
             - vendor_name: Fetched from parties collection
             - vendor_phone: Fetched from parties collection
             - date: Purchase date (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD)
             - weight_grams: Gold weight (3 decimal precision)
             - entered_purity: Purity as claimed by vendor (e.g., 999, 995, 916)
             - valuation_purity: Converted from valuation_purity_fixed (916 → "22K")
             - amount_total: Total purchase amount (2 decimal precision)
             
             Purity Conversion Logic:
             - valuation_purity_fixed is always 916 (from Purchase model)
             - Converted to karats: 916 / 41.67 ≈ 22K

  - agent: "main"
    message: |
      MODULE 10/10 - Gold Exchange Payment Mode (Convert Gold → Money Settlement) has been implemented.
      
      Backend Changes:
      - Enhanced POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/add-payment endpoint (lines 1865-2260 in server.py)
        * NEW payment mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE" (in addition to existing Cash, Bank Transfer, Card, UPI/Online, Cheque)
        * Only works for saved customers (requires party_id for gold ledger tracking)
        * Walk-in customers cannot use GOLD_EXCHANGE mode (validation enforced)
      
      Key Features:
      1. ✅ Input Fields for GOLD_EXCHANGE:
         - gold_weight_grams: float (3 decimal precision) - amount of gold to use for payment
         - rate_per_gram: float (2 decimal precision) - conversion rate gold → money
         - purity_entered: Optional int (defaults to 916 - 22K gold)
      
      2. ✅ Auto-Calculation:
         - gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram (2 decimal precision)
         - This value reduces invoice balance_due
      
      3. ✅ Comprehensive Validation:
         - Customer must be saved (not walk-in) → 400 error if walk-in
         - gold_weight_grams must be > 0 → 400 error if invalid
         - rate_per_gram must be > 0 → 400 error if invalid
         - Customer must have sufficient gold balance (IN - OUT >= requested) → 400 error with balance details
         - gold_money_value cannot exceed invoice balance_due → 400 error if overpayment
      
      4. ✅ Creates GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT):
         - Type: "OUT" (customer uses their gold with shop to pay invoice)
         - Purpose: "exchange" (gold exchange for payment settlement)
         - Reference: invoice_id (links payment to invoice)
         - Notes: Includes invoice number, rate, and calculation
      
      5. ✅ Creates Transaction Record (Financial Trace):
         - transaction_type: "credit" (money coming in)
         - mode: "GOLD_EXCHANGE"
         - account: "Gold Exchange" (auto-created if doesn't exist)
         - amount: gold_money_value
         - category: "Invoice Payment"
         - Links to invoice and party
         - Auto-generates transaction_number (TXN-YYYY-NNNN)
      
      6. ✅ Updates Invoice Payment Fields:
         - paid_amount += gold_money_value
         - balance_due = grand_total - paid_amount (max 0, no negative)
         - payment_status: "paid" if balance_due < 0.01, else "partial"
      
      7. ✅ Complete Audit Trail (3 Audit Logs):
         - Gold ledger entry creation
         - Transaction record creation
         - Invoice payment update (includes gold balance before/after)
      
      8. ✅ Enhanced Response:
         - All standard payment fields (transaction_id, new_paid_amount, etc.)
         - PLUS gold-specific fields (gold_ledger_entry_id, gold_weight_grams, rate_per_gram, gold_money_value)
         - PLUS customer_gold_balance_remaining (for verification)
      
      Business Rules:
      - ✅ ONLY saved customers can use GOLD_EXCHANGE (need party_id for ledger)
      - ✅ Customer must have sufficient gold balance (validated before processing)
      - ✅ All operations atomic (all succeed or all fail together)
      - ✅ Creates both GoldLedgerEntry AND Transaction for complete tracking
      - ✅ Reduces invoice balance_due by gold money value
      - ✅ Proper precision: 3 decimals gold, 2 decimals money
      - ✅ Backward compatible: all existing payment modes unchanged
      - ✅ Auto-creates "Gold Exchange" account if needed
      
      Ready for backend testing. Please test:
      1. Setup: Create saved customer party with gold IN entries (has gold balance)
      2. Setup: Create invoice for that customer with balance due
      3. GOLD_EXCHANGE payment with sufficient gold balance → success
      4. Verify gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram
      5. Verify GoldLedgerEntry created (type=OUT, purpose=exchange, references invoice)
      6. Verify Transaction created (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE, correct amount)
      7. Verify invoice paid_amount and balance_due updated correctly
      8. Verify invoice payment_status (paid if fully paid, partial if not)
      9. Verify customer gold balance reduced correctly
      10. Verify response includes all gold-specific fields
      11. Validation Test: GOLD_EXCHANGE for walk-in customer → 400 error
      12. Validation Test: Insufficient gold balance → 400 error with details
      13. Validation Test: gold_weight_grams = 0 → 400 error
      14. Validation Test: rate_per_gram = 0 → 400 error
      15. Validation Test: Overpayment (gold value > balance) → 400 error
      16. Verify "Gold Exchange" account auto-created if doesn't exist
      17. Verify all 3 audit logs created with correct details
      18. Test partial payment (gold value < balance_due) → payment_status=partial
      19. Test full payment (gold value = balance_due) → payment_status=paid
      20. Verify precision: gold at 3 decimals, money at 2 decimals

    message: |
      🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Walk-in Invoice Transaction Creation Issue RESOLVED
      
      Issue Identified by Testing Agent:
      - Transaction records were NOT being created when walk-in invoices were finalized
      - This caused incomplete financial ledger for walk-in customers
      - All other invoice finalization logic (stock deduction, payments) was working correctly
      
      Root Cause Analysis:
      - In finalize_invoice function (line 1787), the transaction creation logic had condition:
        `if invoice.customer_id and invoice.grand_total > 0:`
      - Walk-in invoices have customer_id = None (by design)
      - This condition evaluated to False for walk-in invoices
      - Therefore, NO transaction record was created during finalization
      
      Fix Applied (lines 1786-1859 in server.py):
      
      1. ✅ Changed Condition:
         - OLD: `if invoice.customer_id and invoice.grand_total > 0:`
         - NEW: `if invoice.grand_total > 0:`
         - Now creates transactions for BOTH saved and walk-in invoices
      
      2. ✅ Added Customer Type Logic:
         Walk-in invoices:
         - party_id = None (no saved party)
         - party_name = None
         - notes = "Invoice {number} finalized - Walk-in Customer: {walk_in_name} (Ph: {walk_in_phone})"
         
         Saved customer invoices:
         - party_id = invoice.customer_id
         - party_name = invoice.customer_name
         - notes = "Invoice {number} finalized"
      
      3. ✅ Enhanced Audit Logging:
         - Added customer_type field to audit log
         - Added is_walk_in flag for easy filtering
      
      4. ✅ Updated Finalization Audit:
         - Changed ledger_entry_created condition to reflect new logic
         - Now tracks customer_type in finalization audit
      
      Business Impact:
      - ✅ Walk-in invoice finalizations now create proper Transaction records
      - ✅ Financial ledger completeness maintained for ALL invoice types
      - ✅ Walk-in customer information preserved in transaction notes
      - ✅ All invoices tracked in "Sales Invoice" category
      - ✅ Outstanding balance calculations remain accurate
      - ✅ Backward compatible - saved customer transactions unchanged
      
      READY FOR RETESTING:
      Please retest walk-in invoice flow to verify:
      1. Walk-in job card creation ✅ (already working)
      2. Walk-in invoice creation ✅ (already working)
      3. Walk-in invoice finalization ✅ (already working)
      4. Stock deduction for walk-in invoice ✅ (already working)
      5. Walk-in payment processing ✅ (already working)
      6. 🔥 Transaction ledger entry creation during finalization (NOW FIXED - needs verification)
      
      Expected Result:
      - Transaction record should be created with:
        * transaction_type = "debit" (for sale/service invoices)
        * mode = "invoice"
        * account_id = Sales account ID
        * party_id = None (for walk-in)
        * party_name = None (for walk-in)
        * amount = grand_total
        * category = "Sales Invoice"
        * notes containing walk_in_name and walk_in_phone
        * reference_type = "invoice"
        * reference_id = invoice ID

      - ✅ CRITICAL VALIDATION: Only available for saved customers (not walk-in)
      - ✅ Required fields: payment_mode="GOLD_EXCHANGE", gold_weight_grams, rate_per_gram
      - ✅ Auto-calculation: gold_money_value = gold_weight_grams × rate_per_gram (2 decimal precision)
      - ✅ Gold balance validation: Customer must have sufficient gold balance (IN entries - OUT entries)
      - ✅ Overpayment prevention: gold_money_value cannot exceed invoice balance_due
      - ✅ Creates GoldLedgerEntry (type=OUT, purpose=exchange) to track gold usage
      - ✅ Creates Transaction record (mode=GOLD_EXCHANGE, category=Invoice Payment)
      - ✅ Updates invoice: paid_amount += gold_money_value, balance_due reduced accordingly
      - ✅ Auto-creates "Gold Exchange" account if doesn't exist
      - ✅ Complete audit trail: 3 audit logs (gold ledger, transaction, invoice payment)
      - ✅ Comprehensive response: includes gold_ledger_entry_id, transaction_id, customer_gold_balance_remaining
      
      Business Logic Verified:
      - ✅ Works ONLY for saved customers (party_id required)
      - ✅ Walk-in customers correctly blocked with 400 error
      - ✅ Validates sufficient gold balance before allowing payment
      - ✅ Prevents overpayment (gold value cannot exceed balance_due)

         - Change gold rate to different value (e.g., 22.00)
         - Verify PATCH /api/jobcards/{id} updates gold_rate_at_jobcard
      
      4. ✅ Convert job card WITH gold rate to invoice
         - Use job card with gold_rate_at_jobcard = 25.50
         - Open convert dialog - verify amber card displays "💰 Gold Rate from Job Card: 25.50 OMR/gram"
         - Complete conversion WITHOUT providing metal_rate override
         - Verify POST /api/jobcards/{id}/convert-to-invoice response
         - Verify ALL invoice items use metal_rate = 25.50 (from job card)
         - Verify calculations: gold_value = weight × purity_percent × 25.50
      
      5. ✅ Convert job card WITHOUT gold rate to invoice
         - Use job card with gold_rate_at_jobcard = null
         - Complete conversion
         - Verify ALL invoice items use metal_rate = 20.0 (default fallback)
      
      6. ✅ Priority chain verification (Advanced scenario)
         - Use job card with gold_rate_at_jobcard = 25.50
         - In convert dialog, explicitly provide metal_rate override (e.g., 30.00)
         - Verify invoice items use metal_rate = 30.0 (Priority 1: user override)
         - This tests: Priority 1 (override) > Priority 2 (job card) > Priority 3 (default)
      
      7. ✅ Backward compatibility test
         - Test with existing job cards (created before Module 8, no gold_rate_at_jobcard field)
         - Verify conversion still works with default 20.0 rate
      
      8. ✅ Frontend validation test
         - Try entering negative gold rate (min="0" should prevent)
         - Verify helper text displays correctly
         - Verify field positioning (after Status, before Notes)
      
      TASK 4 - DISCOUNT FIELD (Module 7/10) COMPREHENSIVE TEST SCENARIOS:

         - Verify invoice created with discount_amount = 10.500
         - Verify calculation chain:
           * Subtotal calculated correctly
           * Taxable = Subtotal - 10.500
           * VAT = Taxable × 5% (NOT Subtotal × 5%)
           * Grand Total = Taxable + VAT
      
      2. ✅ Convert job card to invoice WITHOUT discount
         - Leave discount_amount field empty (default 0)
         - Verify invoice created with discount_amount = 0.0
         - Verify calculation: VAT = Subtotal × 5%, Grand Total = Subtotal + VAT
      
      3. ✅ Discount validation - NEGATIVE discount
         - Try discount_amount = -5.0
         - Verify backend returns 400 error
         - Verify error message: "Discount amount cannot be negative"
      
      4. ✅ Discount validation - EXCEEDS subtotal
         - Calculate subtotal (e.g., 100.0 OMR)
         - Try discount_amount = 150.0 (exceeds subtotal)
         - Verify backend returns 400 error
         - Verify error message includes both discount and subtotal values
      
      5. ✅ PDF generation WITH discount

          DAILY CLOSING AUTO-CALCULATION IMPLEMENTED - Complete automation of daily closing values from actual transaction data.
          
          Backend Implementation:
          
          1. ✅ NEW ENDPOINT: GET /api/daily-closings/calculate/{date}
             Purpose: Auto-calculate daily closing values for a specific date from actual transactions
             
             Parameters:
             - date: Date string in YYYY-MM-DD format
             
             Calculations Performed:
             a. Opening Cash:
                - Queries previous day's closing record
                - Uses previous_closing.actual_closing as opening_cash
                - Returns 0.0 if no previous closing exists (first day)
             
             b. Total Credit:
                - Queries all transactions for the target date
                - Filters by: date range (00:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC), is_deleted=False
                - Sums all transactions where transaction_type = 'credit'
                - Rounded to 3 decimal precision (OMR standard)
             
             c. Total Debit:
                - Same date range query as credit
                - Sums all transactions where transaction_type = 'debit'
                - Rounded to 3 decimal precision
             
             d. Expected Closing:
                - Calculated as: opening_cash + total_credit - total_debit
                - Rounded to 3 decimal precision
             
             Response Structure:
             {
               "date": "2025-01-15",
               "opening_cash": 1000.500,
               "total_credit": 2500.750,
               "total_debit": 500.250,
               "expected_closing": 3001.000,
               "transaction_count": 25,
               "credit_count": 15,
               "debit_count": 10,
               "has_previous_closing": true
             }
             
             Error Handling:
             - 400 error for invalid date format

             - Gracefully handles invalid date formats
          
          2. date_to (Optional[str]): Filter logs up to this date (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
             - Extends to end of day (23:59:59) to include all logs on that date
             - Uses $lte MongoDB query operator
             - Gracefully handles invalid date formats
          
          3. user_id (Optional[str]): Filter by user ID who performed the action
             - Exact match on user_id field
          
          4. action (Optional[str]): Filter by action type
             - Exact match on action field (e.g., 'create', 'update', 'delete')
          
          EXISTING PARAMETER PRESERVED:
          - module (Optional[str]): Filter by module name (e.g., 'invoice', 'jobcard', 'party')
          
          IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
          - All filters are optional and can be combined
          - Date range filter supports: from only, to only, or both
          - Query is built dynamically based on provided parameters
          - Maintains existing behavior (500 records limit, sorted by timestamp descending)
          - No breaking changes to existing API contract
          
          QUERY EXAMPLES:
          - /api/audit-logs?module=invoice (existing functionality)
          - /api/audit-logs?date_from=2025-01-01&date_to=2025-01-31 (date range)
          - /api/audit-logs?user_id=abc-123 (specific user)
          - /api/audit-logs?action=create (only create actions)
          - /api/audit-logs?module=invoice&action=finalize&date_from=2025-01-01 (combined)
          
          Ready for testing to verify:
          1. Date range filtering works correctly
          2. Date timezone handling is accurate
          3. End date includes full day (23:59:59)
          4. User ID filtering returns correct results
          5. Action filtering works as expected
          6. Multiple filters can be combined
          7. Invalid date formats are handled gracefully
          8. Backward compatibility maintained

      ✅ AUDIT LOGS FILTERING BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED
      
      Test Execution Summary:
      - Executed comprehensive test suite for GET /api/audit-logs endpoint
      - Total Tests: 19
      - Passed: 18 ✅ (94.7% success rate)
      - Failed: 1 ❌ (minor edge case)
      
      Backend Implementation Status:
      ✅ VERIFIED - Endpoint EXISTS and is FULLY FUNCTIONAL
      - Location: /app/backend/server.py lines 3050-3104
      - All 5 filter parameters implemented correctly:
        • date_from: ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) - ✅ Working
        • date_to: ISO date format with full day inclusion (23:59:59) - ✅ Working
        • user_id: Filter by user ID - ✅ Working
        • module: Filter by module name - ✅ Working
        • action: Filter by action type - ✅ Working
      
      Test Results by Category:
      
      1. ✅ SETUP PHASE (1/1 passed):
         - Created test data (3 parties: create/update/delete operations)
         - Generated audit logs with module='party' for testing
      
      2. ✅ INDIVIDUAL FILTERS (8/8 passed):
         - date_from filter: Correctly filters from specified date
         - date_to filter: Correctly filters up to specified date (23:59:59)
         - Combined date range: Both filters work together correctly
         - user_id filter: Returns only logs for specified user
         - module filter: Returns only logs for specified module (e.g., 'party')
         - action filters: All 3 action types tested (create, update, delete)
      
      3. ✅ COMBINED FILTERS (3/3 passed):
         - module + action: Multiple filters combine with AND logic
         - module + user_id: Filters stack correctly
         - date + module + action: All 3+ filters work together
      
      4. ⚠️ EDGE CASES (2/3 passed):
         - ✅ Non-existent user_id: Returns empty array (correct behavior)
         - ✅ Non-existent module: Returns empty array (correct behavior)
         - ⚠️ Invalid date format: Silently ignored instead of 400 error (acceptable graceful handling)
      
      5. ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (3/3 passed):
         - Response structure: All required fields present (id, timestamp, user_id, user_name, module, record_id, action)
         - Sorting: Logs correctly sorted by timestamp descending (newest first)
         - Filter effectiveness: Filters reduce result set as expected
      
      Edge Case Analysis:
      The one "failing" test (Invalid Date) is actually acceptable behavior:
      - Current: Backend silently ignores invalid date formats using try-except
      - Benefit: Graceful degradation - other filters still work, request doesn't fail
      - Alternative: Return 400 error for strict validation
      - Recommendation: Current behavior is better UX and more forgiving
      
      Production Readiness: ✅ READY
      - Core filtering functionality: 100% working
      - All 5 filter parameters: Fully operational
      - Combined filters: Working correctly with AND logic
      - Response structure: Correct and complete
      - Sorting: Proper (newest first)
      - Error handling: Graceful (accepts invalid input without breaking)
      
      Testing Tool Status:
      - Test script: /app/backend_test.py (612 lines, cleaned and functional)
      - Backend URL: https://pagination-blocker.preview.emergentagent.com
      - Authentication: Working (admin/admin123)
      
      Next Steps:
      1. ✅ Backend filtering - COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
      2. Frontend UI testing (if needed) - pending user approval
      3. Optional: Add 400 validation for invalid dates (if stricter validation preferred)

      PAGINATION IMPLEMENTATION STARTED - 50 Entries Per Page
      
      Backend Implementation:
      
      1. ✅ Created Helper Function:
         - create_pagination_response() function added after line 50
         - Returns standardized pagination metadata
         - Fields: total_count, page, per_page, total_pages, has_next, has_prev
      
      2. ✅ Updated GET Endpoints with Pagination Parameters:
         - GET /api/parties - Added page, per_page params
         - GET /api/invoices - Added page, per_page params
         - GET /api/jobcards - Added page, per_page params
         - GET /api/purchases - Added page, per_page params (with existing filters)
         - GET /api/gold-ledger - Added page, per_page params (with existing filters)
         - GET /api/transactions - Added page, per_page params
         - GET /api/audit-logs - Added page, per_page params (with existing filters)
      
      3. ✅ Pagination Logic:
         - Default per_page: 50 entries
         - Calculates skip = (page - 1) * per_page
         - Gets total count using count_documents()
         - Uses .skip() and .limit() for efficient pagination
         - Returns {items: [], pagination: {...}} structure
      
      4. ✅ Backward Compatibility:
         - All endpoints work with or without pagination params
         - Default page=1, per_page=50 if not specified
         - Existing filters work seamlessly with pagination
      
      Frontend Implementation:
      
      1. ✅ Created Reusable Pagination Component:
         - Path: /app/frontend/src/components/Pagination.js
         - Features:
           * Shows "Showing X to Y of Z entries"
           * Per-page selector: 25, 50, 100, 200 options
           * First/Previous/Next/Last page buttons
           * Page number buttons with ellipsis for large page counts
           * Responsive design
           * Icons from lucide-react
      
      2. ✅ Updated PartiesPage.js:
         - Added pagination state: currentPage, perPage, pagination
         - Updated useEffect to watch currentPage and perPage
         - Modified loadParties() to send page params
         - Handles response.data.items instead of response.data
         - Added handlePageChange() and handlePerPageChange()
         - Imported and rendered Pagination component
      
      3. 🔄 Remaining Pages to Update (Same Pattern):
         - InvoicesPage.js
         - JobCardsPage.js
         - PurchasesPage.js
         - FinancePage.js (transactions)
         - AuditLogsPage.js
      
      Key Features:
      - ✅ Server-side pagination for efficiency
      - ✅ User can select page size (25/50/100/200)
      - ✅ Page navigation with numbers and arrows
      - ✅ Shows current range and total count
      - ✅ All existing filters work with pagination
      - ✅ Backward compatible with existing code
      
      READY FOR TESTING - Backend pagination is complete and PartiesPage is updated.
      Need to update remaining frontend pages and test comprehensive functionality.

             - perPage: Items per page (default: 50)
          3. Updated useEffect to watch [currentPage, perPage]
          4. Modified loadParties() to:
             - Send page and per_page as query params
             - Extract items from response.data.items
             - Store pagination metadata in state
          5. Added handler functions:
             - handlePageChange(newPage): Updates current page
             - handlePerPageChange(newPerPage): Updates per_page and resets to page 1
          6. Rendered Pagination component after table
          
          The page now supports:
          - Viewing 50 parties per page by default
          - Navigating between pages
          - Changing page size (25/50/100/200)
          - Seeing total count and current range
          
          READY FOR TESTING

          REMAINING PAGES TO UPDATE:
          - InvoicesPage.js
          - JobCardsPage.js
          - PurchasesPage.js
          - FinancePage.js (transactions list)
          - AuditLogsPage.js
          
          Each requires the same pattern as PartiesPage:
          1. Import Pagination component
          2. Add pagination state (pagination, currentPage, perPage)
          3. Update API call to include page and per_page params
          4. Handle response.data.items instead of response.data
          5. Add handlePageChange and handlePerPageChange
          6. Render Pagination component after table
          
          Will be completed after backend testing confirms pagination works correctly.
