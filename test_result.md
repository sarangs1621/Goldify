# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Fix invoice print issues, complete daily closing, make all reports load correctly, add making-charge (flat/per-gram) and VAT options in create job card, and allow removing/editing items in new job cards. All changes must be backward-compatible. CRITICAL: Implement invoice state management (Draft/Finalized) to fix stock deduction logic - stock should ONLY be deducted when invoice is finalized, not on creation. ADDITIONAL: Implement job card locking with admin override and audit logging. NEW REQUIREMENT: Change stock deduction to directly reduce from inventory category quantities and weights instead of using separate dedication records. CURRENT REQUIREMENT: Implement walk-in vs saved customer handling with payment tracking - walk-in customers enter name/phone but are NOT saved in Parties, all payments create Transaction records. LATEST REQUIREMENT: Implement comprehensive Reports & Filters system with: (1) Global filters (Date presets, Party dropdown, Type filters, Sorting) on ALL reports. (2) Outstanding Report with overdue buckets (0-7, 8-30, 31+ days), customer due vs vendor payable breakdown. (3) Enhanced Finance Summary with Cash balance, Bank balance, Net flow, Daily closing difference. (4) PDF & Excel export for all reports with applied filters."

Changes: (1) Added current_qty and current_weight fields to InventoryHeader model for direct stock tracking. (2) Modified POST /api/inventory/movements endpoint to DIRECTLY update header current values when movements are created, with validation to prevent negative stock. (3) Modified GET /api/inventory/stock-totals to return current values from headers instead of aggregating movements. (4) CRITICAL CHANGE in POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize - Now DIRECTLY reduces current_qty and current_weight from inventory headers based on invoice item categories. Stock movements still created as audit trail. Validation added to prevent insufficient stock errors. (5) Added category field to InvoiceItem model to track which inventory category to reduce from. (6) Updated job card to invoice conversion to include category field. (7) Created migration script to initialize current stock values from existing movements. This ensures stock is reduced directly from categories instead of using separate dedication/movement records, while maintaining complete audit trail for compliance."

Changes: (1) Added invoice status badge column showing 'Draft' (blue) or 'Finalized' (green with lock icon). (2) Added 'Finalize' button for draft invoices with confirmation dialog explaining all consequences (stock deduction, invoice lock, job card lock, ledger entry creation). (3) Separated invoice status from payment status for clarity. (4) Added informational card explaining Draft vs Finalized workflow. (5) Button shows loading state while finalizing and is disabled during process. (6) Finalized invoices only show Print button, draft invoices show both Finalize and Print buttons. This completes the full invoice state management implementation - backend was correct but frontend lacked the UI to trigger finalization, meaning all invoices stayed in draft state forever with no stock deduction happening. Now users can properly finalize invoices through a clear, safe workflow. READY FOR TESTING - Need to verify: (a) Draft invoices display correctly with status badge, (b) Finalize button appears and works, (c) Confirmation dialog shows, (d) Status updates to Finalized after confirmation, (e) Finalize button disappears for finalized invoices, (f) Stock movements are created, (g) Job cards get locked, (h) Customer ledger entries are created."

FIX IMPLEMENTED: Added Status dropdown field in job card create/edit form with options: Created, In Progress, Completed, Delivered, Cancelled. Users can now: (1) Edit existing job cards and change status to 'Completed'. (2) Set status when creating new job cards. (3) Convert to Invoice button will appear once status is set to 'Completed'. This gives users full control over job card workflow status."

For 'Saved Customer': Shows party dropdown with existing customers, displays info about ledger tracking and outstanding. For 'Walk-in Customer': Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional), displays warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties and full payment is recommended. (4) Updated Convert to Invoice button to pass entire jobcard object instead of just ID. InvoicesPage changes: (1) Added payment dialog functionality with accounts loading. (2) Updated invoice table to show 'Walk-in' badge for walk-in customers with walk_in_name display. (3) Added 'Add Payment' button for all invoices with balance_due > 0. (4) Created payment dialog with: amount input (default to full balance), payment mode dropdown (Cash/Bank Transfer/Card/UPI/Online/Cheque), account selection (where money goes), notes field. Shows walk-in warning for partial payments. (5) handleAddPayment function calls POST /api/invoices/{id}/add-payment and shows warning toast for walk-in partial payments.

        comment: "CRITICAL FIX - Added Toggle Option in Job Card Creation Form: User reported missing toggle to select between walk-in and saved customers in job card creation. ROOT CAUSE: Customer type selection was only available during invoice conversion, not during job card creation itself. FIX IMPLEMENTED: (1) Added prominent Customer Type radio button section at the top of job card form with 'Saved Customer' and 'Walk-in Customer' options. (2) Dynamic form fields based on selection: For Saved Customer - Shows party dropdown with ledger tracking info message. For Walk-in Customer - Shows name input (required) and phone input (optional) with warning that walk-in customers are NOT saved in Parties. (3) Updated job card table to display walk-in badge next to customer name for easy identification. (4) Enhanced convert-to-invoice dialog to show job card's original customer type and pre-populate fields accordingly. (5) Form validation ensures: saved customers must select from parties, walk-in customers must enter name. RESULT: Users now have clear, upfront control over customer handling from job card creation. Walk-in vs saved distinction is visible throughout the entire workflow. Backend already supported these fields (customer_type, walk_in_name, walk_in_phone). Payment tracking creates Transaction records for all payments as required. Ready for testing."

Fix implemented: (1) Added invoice status badges (Draft/Finalized with lock icon). (2) Added Finalize button with comprehensive confirmation dialog. (3) Separated invoice status from payment status columns for clarity. (4) Added info card explaining workflow. (5) Finalize button calls POST /api/invoices/{id}/finalize and reloads data.

    message: "PHASE 1 & 2 COMPLETED: Enhanced Reports API and UI implemented. Added comprehensive filtering (date range, status, type, category), view endpoints for displaying data in UI, individual report details (invoice, party ledger, inventory stock), and export with filters. Reports page now has tabbed interface with Inventory, Invoices, Parties, and Transactions sections. Backend CRUD operations were already implemented. Now ready for testing."
