# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🚨 COMPREHENSIVE STRESS TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL PRODUCTION-READINESS BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED
      
      TESTING STATUS: CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES DISCOVERED AND RESOLVED
      
      ❌ CRITICAL PRODUCTION-READINESS BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED:
      ================================================================================
      
      1. ❌ APPLICATION DOWNTIME - CRITICAL BLOCKER
         - Backend and Frontend services were completely STOPPED
         - Application was returning "Web server returned an unknown error"
         - HTTP 520 errors preventing all access
         - IMPACT: Complete system unavailability
         - STATUS: ✅ RESOLVED - Services restarted successfully
      
      2. ❌ MISSING DEPENDENCIES - CRITICAL BLOCKER  
         - @craco/craco dependency missing from node_modules
         - Frontend build system completely broken
         - "craco: not found" errors in logs
         - IMPACT: Frontend cannot start or compile
         - STATUS: ✅ RESOLVED - Installed with npm install --legacy-peer-deps
      
      3. ❌ DEPENDENCY VERSION CONFLICTS - HIGH PRIORITY
         - date-fns version conflict (v4.1.0 vs required ^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0)
         - react-day-picker compatibility issues
         - ERESOLVE dependency resolution failures
         - IMPACT: Build failures and potential runtime issues
         - STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Used --legacy-peer-deps workaround
      
      4. ❌ SECURITY VULNERABILITIES - HIGH PRIORITY
         - 12 npm security vulnerabilities detected
         - 2 low, 3 moderate, 7 high severity issues
         - Potential security risks in production
         - IMPACT: Security exposure and compliance issues
         - STATUS: ❌ UNRESOLVED - Requires npm audit fix
      
      ⚠️ ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CONCERNS:
      ================================================================================
      
      5. ⚠️ DEPRECATED WEBPACK WARNINGS
         - onBeforeSetupMiddleware and onAfterSetupMiddleware deprecated
         - Development server configuration outdated
         - IMPACT: Future compatibility issues
      
      6. ⚠️ REACT HOOK DEPENDENCY WARNINGS
         - Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
         - PurchasesPage.js and ReportsPageEnhanced.js affected
         - IMPACT: Potential runtime bugs and memory leaks
      
      ✅ STRESS TESTING RESULTS - FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION:
      ================================================================================
      
      ✅ AUTHENTICATION & SESSION MANAGEMENT - WORKING
         - Login form validation working correctly
         - Rapid login attempts handled properly
         - Session persistence across page refresh
         - Protected route access control functional
         - Proper redirects for unauthorized access
      
      ✅ PURCHASES MODULE - CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING
         - Form validation prevents invalid submissions
         - Validation errors shown for: empty vendor, zero/negative values
         - Rapid form submission protection working
         - Form data cleared properly on navigation/refresh
         - No data persistence issues detected
      
      ✅ NAVIGATION & STATE MANAGEMENT - WORKING
         - Page routing functional across all modules
         - Back button navigation working correctly
         - Page refresh handling proper
         - No state persistence issues during navigation
         - Form dialogs close properly on page changes
      
      ❌ UX ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION:
      ================================================================================
      
      1. Limited loading states during async operations
      2. No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
      3. Form validation could be more user-friendly
      4. Error messages could be more descriptive
      5. No progress indicators for long-running operations
      
      📊 PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT:
      ================================================================================
      
      OVERALL SCORE: 6/10 - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIXES BEFORE PRODUCTION
      
      CRITICAL BLOCKERS RESOLVED: ✅
      - Application now accessible and functional
      - Core business logic working correctly
      - Authentication and security working
      
      IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
      1. 🔴 HIGH: Fix npm security vulnerabilities (npm audit fix --force)
      2. 🔴 HIGH: Properly resolve dependency version conflicts
      3. 🟡 MEDIUM: Update webpack configuration for deprecated warnings
      4. 🟡 MEDIUM: Fix React hook dependency warnings
      5. 🟡 MEDIUM: Add loading states and confirmation dialogs
      
      RECOMMENDATION:
      The application is now FUNCTIONAL but requires security and dependency fixes before production deployment. Core business functionality works correctly, but infrastructure issues must be addressed for production readiness.
